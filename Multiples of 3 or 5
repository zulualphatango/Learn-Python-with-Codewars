notes  
in num
check numbers below num
get ones dividable by 3 or 5 
get dividable by 15(3 AND 5) only once
get sum of these numbers
return 0 if num<0

use for loops to iterate with %3==0, %5==0, latter include %15==0 check, don't add if it's true
ifelse for num<0 check

code
'''return the sum of numbers below input num that are dividable by 3 or 5 (3 AND 5 only counts once)
return 0 if num<0'''

if(num>0):
#div3==0?
for nums in num:
  
else
  return 0
