after action report
my pythons skills are rusty, thus I make many syntax error -> practice + w3 guides + online IDE
task is ambiguous, I've tested my understanding with hand, so code should work without errors
lack of details examples leave only try and error method -> get more information or skip tasks  

notes 
https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/
many typos, syntax errors
now using online ide instead of text editor
ide works, mistake in the sketch

sketch
in num
check numbers below num
get ones dividable by 3 or 5 
get dividable by 15(3 AND 5) only once
get sum of these numbers
return 0 if num<0


use for loops to iterate with %3==0, %5==0, latter include %15==0 check, don't add if it's true
ifelse for num<0 check

code
# Online Python compiler (interpreter) to run Python online.
# Write Python 3 code in this online editor and run it.

def solution(number):
    '''return the sum of numbers below input num that are dividable by 3 or 5 (3 AND 5 only counts once)
return 0 if num<0'''
    if(number>0):
        sum = 0   
    #div3==0?
        for nums in range(number-1):
            #print(nums)
            if(nums%3==0):
                sum += nums
            if(nums%5==0):
                #exclude double counting %3*5==0
                if(nums%(3*5)==0):
                    continue
                sum += nums
            #print(sum)
        return sum
    else:
        return 0

print(solution(14))
